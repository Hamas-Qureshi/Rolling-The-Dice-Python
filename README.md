# Rolling-The-Dice-Python
An organized roll the dice program
import random in order to generate two random numbers
We set two variables (min and max), lowest and highest number of the dice to set the limit.
Assuming the user might want to roll the dice again we will use a while loop

The roll_again here is set to "yes" or "y", so that it can enter while loop. Other variation could've added too.
